This fork was created to alter kicad way of working for my (and maybe others)
comfort, including a lot of changes which never would be accepted by kicad
developers(mouse/hotkey behavior, etc).

New TODO is TODO.md, original TODO.txt left untouched.

Changes:
 - Pan with right mouse button instead of middle button
 - eeschema: don't start drawing(bus, wire, hier sheet, graphic polyline) or placing item(junction,wire entry, bus entry, no conn flag) on hotkey just selects the tool
